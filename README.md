## 📖 About This Repository
This is my personal R&D lab for **Data Structures and Algorithms**. Unlike my LeetCode Solutions repo which focuses on solving specific contest problems, this repository focuses on **foundational implementations**.

Here, I build data structures from scratch to ensure a deep understanding of memory management, pointers, and algorithmic efficiency.

## 📂 Focus Areas

### 🔗 Core Data Structures
*Implemented from scratch without using built-in libraries.*
- **Linked Lists:** Singly and Circular Linked List implementations (Traversal, Insertion, Deletion).
- **Arrays & Matrices:** Optimized manipulation of 2D arrays and buffers.
- **Hash Maps & Strings:** Frequency analysis and string manipulation logic.

### ⚡ Algorithmic Patterns
- **Pointers:** Logic for traversing and manipulating non-linear data structures.
- **Recursion & Iteration:** Comparing iterative vs recursive approaches for efficiency.
- **Complexity Analysis:** Focus on understanding Time (Big O) and Space complexity for every solution.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Goal:** Deep conceptual understanding of Computer Science fundamentals.

## 🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository and run any script directly to see the implementation output:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/aranya-code/PracticeQuestionsDSA.git](https://github.com/aranya-code/PracticeQuestionsDSA.git)
cd PracticeQuestionsDSA
# Run any python file, e.g.:
python <filename>.py
